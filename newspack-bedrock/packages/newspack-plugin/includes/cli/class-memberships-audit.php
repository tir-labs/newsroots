	 *
	 * WooCommerce Memberships grants content access to the membership holder
	 * (the `wc_user_membership` post author). Access Control's `subscription`
	 * access rule grants it to the subscription's *customer*. Two shapes make
	 * those disagree, and neither is visible in the plan→gate translation or in
	 * the access-parity diff (where they hide inside the comp/legacy bucket and
	 * get written off as accepted loss):
	 *
	 * - **gift**: the membership sits on the recipient's account while the
	 *   subscription stays with the buyer. At the flip the reader loses access
	 *   and the buyer gains access they never had.
	 * - **order-only**: the membership is backed by a paid one-off order with no
	 *   subscription behind it.
	 * - **gift-wcsg-inert**: the subscription carries Subscriptions Gifting data
	 *   that nothing on the site resolves, so access stays with the buyer. Fixed
	 *   by restoring the gifting integration, not by granting access.
	 *
	 * Every other membership is counted under a named class, so the per-plan
	 * summary reconciles against the plan's member count rather than leaving a
	 * remainder to guess at.
	 *
	 * This command only reads. Buyer-vs-recipient intent is a publisher
	 * question, so it reports pairs as evidence and decides nothing: no
	 * subscription is re-homed and no access is granted. `--format=ids` emits
	 * the signed-off list for `migrate-manual-members --product-id=<id>
	 * --user-ids-file=<path> --live`, which grants the replacement access.
	 *
	 * ## OPTIONS
	 *
	 * [--plan-ids=<ids>]
	 * : Comma-delimited membership plan IDs to audit — the plans whose content the new gates cover. Omit the flag to audit every published plan (a plan in any other status is audited only when named here); passing it with no ID is an error.
	 *
	 * [--only=<classes>]
	 * : Comma-delimited classes to report member-by-member: gift, order-only, order-only-unpaid, subscription-missing, gift-wcsg-inert, outside-active-period. Omit the flag for the default gift + order-only report; passing it with no class is an error. Counts for every class are printed regardless — on STDERR in the machine-readable formats.
	 *
	 * [--sleep=<seconds>]
	 * : Seconds to pause between batches of memberships, to keep a full-table walk from monopolising the database on a live site. Pass 0 to run flat out.
	 * ---
	 * default: 2
	 * ---
	 *
	 * [--format=<format>]
	 * : Output format. `ids` prints only the flagged user IDs, one per line, deduplicated per user. csv, json and ids keep STDOUT to the data alone and send the class counts and any warnings to STDERR, so the stream stays parseable when redirected to a file.
	 * ---
	 * default: table
	 * options:
	 *   - table
	 *   - csv
	 *   - json
	 *   - ids
	 * ---
