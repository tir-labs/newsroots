 * Sibling of the migrate-membership-gates command: same grouping, titling and
 * verification shape, applied to the premium newsletter gate bucket instead of the
 * content gate bucket. A premium newsletter gate is an ordinary content gate
 * carrying `is_newsletter` post meta, which the evaluator uses to decide which
 * bucket a post is judged against — so migrating one is a matter of writing the
 * right rules and mode settings, not of authoring layouts.
 *
 * The class file is included on every request like the other CLI classes; only the
 * command registration is gated on WP_CLI.

	/**
	 * Create or update Newspack Access Control premium newsletter gates from
	 * WooCommerce Membership plans.
	 *
	 * For each published plan carrying a newsletter-list content restriction rule,
	 * writes the equivalent premium newsletter gate: the plan's lists as the gate's
	 * restricted lists, and the plan's products as its paid access rules. Plans
	 * restricting the same lists are grouped and represented by a single gate whose
	 * title is all matching plan names joined with " | ".
	 *
	 * Registration mode is always activated; paid access mode only when every plan in
	 * the group requires a purchase (see group_requires_purchase()). The site-wide
	 * auto-signup setting is derived from the post-checkout signup modal. Settling
	 * that setting takes a full run: it is one option for the whole site, so a
	 * --plan run reports what it would be but never writes it.
	 *
	 * Dry-run by default; pass --live to write.
	 *
	 * Re-running overwrites a matching gate's content rules and mode settings, but
	 * never its layouts: this command does not author them, and a publisher may have
	 * customized one in Newsletters > Premium.
	 *
	 * Both modes surface predictable problems as WARN rows. On --live each written
	 * gate is re-read and checked against the conditions the frontend evaluator
	 * applies. Migrated gates stay dormant until WooCommerce Memberships is
	 * deactivated, so without this an unenforceable gate would look migrated for as
	 * long as it takes someone to notice at cutover.
	 *
	 * Every decision that needs an operator is settled before the first write: the
	 * groups are scanned, the problems are reported, and the one confirmation prompt
	 * is asked with nothing yet written. The write loop then runs to completion
	 * unattended, so a run that is interrupted at a prompt is a run that changed
	 * nothing.
	 *
	 * ## OPTIONS
	 *
	 * [--live]
	 * : Apply the changes. Without this flag the command runs as a dry-run and writes nothing.
	 *
	 * [--plan=<id>]
	 * : Only process the plan with this post ID. Useful for testing; never writes the site-wide auto-signup setting.
	 *
	 * [--one-time-duration=<duration>]
	 * : How long access lasts after a one-time purchase. Accepts "forever", "<n>days" or "<n>months". Each plan's own access length is read by default, so this is only needed for a plan whose access ends on a fixed calendar date, which is not a duration from the purchase. Applies to every such plan in the run.
	 *
	 * [--set-auto-signup]
	 * : Apply the derived auto-signup setting even though the site already has one set. Without this the command reports the difference and leaves the existing setting alone, because it is a publisher's choice rather than a migration artefact. A site that has never set it is written either way.
	 *
	 * [--yes]
	 * : Answer yes to the pre-flight confirmation prompt shown when gates would be created alongside gates the same plans were migrated to individually. Required for non-interactive runs (cron, `ssh host "wp ..."`): with no terminal to answer the prompt, the command errors out rather than exiting silently mid-migration.

	 * - `content_rules_match` is 'any' because the gate carries exactly one content
	 *   rule, on which 'any' and 'all' agree. 'any' is the safer of the two to fix
	 *   here: should a second rule ever join it, 'any' restricts a post on either
	 *   list, while 'all' would restrict only posts on both and quietly open the rest.
	 * - Registration mode is always active because every plan this command migrates
	 *   grants membership to an account — a purchase plan to the purchasing account, a
	 *   signup plan to the registering one. Manual-only plans, the one shape that can
	 *   hold a reader who never registered, never reach here: group_plans_by_lists()
	 *   skips them. So requiring registration never restricts a reader the plan admitted.
	 * - The paid access mode carries a rule only when the group requires a purchase AND
	 *   at least one product ID survives, and it carries one rule group per kind of
	 *   product the plans grant on. An active mode with no rules asks for no purchase at
	 *   all, so the empty shape is left empty deliberately for verify_migrated_gate() and
	 *   compute_pre_write_issues() to flag, rather than papered over with a rule that
	 *   would grant more than the plan did.
	 * - A one-time rule needs a duration, so a group whose plans cannot supply one gets
	 *   no rule while its one-time product IDs stay in the payload. That shape never
	 *   reaches a write because migrate_premium_newsletters() refuses the run over it;

	/**
	 * Derive, report, and (in live mode) write the site-wide auto-signup setting.
	 *
	 * A site that has never set the option is written without ceremony: there is no
	 * choice to override, and a zero-touch migration is the whole point. A site that
	 * has one set is left alone and told about the difference instead. The stored
	 * value and the default are both readable as "on", so a run that overwrote them
	 * alike would silently undo a publisher who had turned auto-signup off — and
	 * turning it back on subscribes their readers to lists at the provider, which is
	 * not something to do on an inference. --set-auto-signup is how an operator says
	 * they mean it.
	 *
	 * A run in which any group failed to write, or was reported as a WARN row, takes
	 * the same report-only path. The derivation is over the lists this run migrated,
	 * and a group that wrote nothing — or wrote a gate the evaluator cannot enforce —
	 * keeps its lists out of that view. Dropping lists can only collapse a
	 * disagreement into a determinate value, never the reverse, and the option
	 * defaults to ON: so the shape that does damage is a modal group succeeding while
	 * a non-modal group fails, which derives false and turns auto-signup off
	 * site-wide from a partial view. Members then stop being auto-subscribed to lists
	 * they should get, with nothing to show for it. Re-runs are idempotent, so fixing
	 * the failure and running again settles the setting.
	 *
	 * The boundary is this run's summary rows. A plan skipped before any write is not
	 * counted here; a manual-only plan's lists are named in their own warning instead
	 * ({@see report_manual_only_plan()}).
	 *
	 * A --plan run is the exception: the option is site-wide, but the derivation only
	 * sees the lists that one plan restricts. If the site's other lists sit on the
	 * other side of the modal split, writing it would flip a global setting from a
	 * partial view — turning auto-signup on for readers who declined those lists at
	 * checkout, or off for readers who expected them. So a --plan run reports the
	 * derivation and says why it is not written; settling the setting takes a full run.
	 *
	 * @param int[] $list_ids          All newsletter list IDs this run migrated.
	 * @param bool  $dry_run           Whether this is a dry run.
	 * @param bool  $plan_scoped       Whether the run was narrowed to a single plan with --plan.
	 * @param int   $incomplete_groups How many groups failed to write or will not enforce
