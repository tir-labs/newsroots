	/**
	 * Compare premium newsletter gates against the ESP and report the difference.
	 *
	 * For each gate with an active paid access mode, collects every reader who
	 * holds or has ever held one of its products, asks the gate whether each is
	 * entitled to its restricted lists, asks the ESP whether each is subscribed,
	 * and reports where the two disagree.
	 *
	 * Run this after WooCommerce Memberships is deactivated. Before that the
	 * evaluator hands restriction decisions back to Memberships, so every list
	 * reads as unrestricted and the comparison is meaningless — the command
	 * refuses rather than producing a misleading clean result.
	 *
	 * Exits non-zero while any leak or unresolved row remains, and while the run's
	 * coverage is incomplete, so a cutover script can gate on it. A clean result
	 * over a population the run never finished walking is not evidence of anything,
	 * and must not read the same as a full pass.
	 *
	 * What a passing run claims is bounded by that population: readers who hold or
	 * have held one of a gate's products. It cannot see a reader who satisfied the
	 * source Memberships plan by buying a non-subscription product (the migration
	 * writes those product IDs into a `subscription` access rule, which a
	 * subscription lookup can never match), one who joined a list before it
	 * became premium, one whose membership was granted by hand, or a
	 * group-subscription member — entitled through someone else's subscription
	 * rather than holding one themselves, per Access_Rules::has_active_subscription()
	 * (includes/content-gate/class-access-rules.php). That population query keys on
	 * who holds a subscription, so a current group member missing from a list is
	 * never reported as a gap, and a lapsed group member still on a paid list is a
	 * leak this command cannot see either. Widening the population would not reach
	 * any of them — there is no provider-agnostic bulk read of ESP list membership
	 * to widen it with — so the terminal message names the population it checked
	 * rather than claiming the site as a whole.
	 *
	 * The same boundary decides which gates it can speak for at all. A gate
	 * paywalled by a rule other than `subscription` — a one-time purchase, an
	 * institution, an email domain, reader data — restricts readers this command
	 * cannot list, so it is named in the output and fails the run rather than
	 * passing as "nothing to verify". See unenumerable_paid_rules().
	 *
	 * Each reader costs two ESP calls, not one: a contact lookup before the list
	 * read, because every shipped provider's list read swallows a failed request
	 * into an empty array and cannot itself tell a reader with no contact apart
	 * from one the provider simply failed to answer for. The contact lookup
	 * recovers that distinction for a reader who has no contact at all — but not
	 * past it: a reader whose contact lookup succeeds and whose list read then
	 * fails still reads as subscribed to nothing, the same as a genuinely
	 * unsubscribed reader. That window is narrow, and an outage large enough to
	 * matter trips the contact lookup for everyone, so it is left as is.
	 *
	 * A --live removal costs more again, on the write path only: the removal itself
	 * re-reads the contact before writing, and this command then re-reads the
	 * contact's lists to confirm the list is actually gone.
	 *
	 * ## OPTIONS
	 *
	 * [--live]
	 * : Remove readers from lists they are not entitled to. Without this flag the command reports and writes nothing. It never adds a reader to a list: an on-demand reconcile cannot tell a reader who never subscribed from one who deliberately unsubscribed, so additions are left to the auto-signup flow, where the renewal snapshot protects an opt-out.
	 *
	 * [--gate=<id>]
	 * : Only verify this gate.
	 *
	 * [--batch-size=<number>]
	 * : Readers to check between pauses. Default 100. A dry run costs two ESP calls per reader — a contact lookup and a list read. Under --live each removal adds more on top: the removal itself re-reads the contact before writing, and this command re-reads the contact's lists afterwards to confirm the removal landed. So a large batch size is a large burst of API traffic, and larger still on a run that is removing.
	 *
	 * [--max-batches=<number>]
	 * : Stop after roughly this many batches, across the whole run. Useful for sampling a large site before committing to a full run: the population is walked lazily, so a run that stops early never reads the rest of it. Must be a positive integer; omit it for no limit. Not an exact cap: a gate's last batch is never counted against it, so a run spanning several gates can check somewhat more readers than batch-size times max-batches implies.
	 *
	 * [--format=<format>]
	 * : Format for the per-reader rows. Under --live those rows name every reader unsubscribed at the ESP, so a machine-readable format is worth archiving with the site's migration record.
	 * ---
	 * default: table
	 * options:
	 *   - table
	 *   - csv
	 *   - json
	 *   - yaml

	 * One reader's ESP list membership, and whether it can be trusted.

	 * its WP_Error code names a genuine miss on all three providers, so a reader with
	 * no contact counts as "on no lists" rather than failing.
	 *
	 * That pre-read does not cover the remaining ambiguity — an empty list set from a
	 * contact that exists is both what a reader on no lists looks like and what a
	 * failed list read returns. On Mailchimp and Constant Contact the list read is a
	 * second, un-memoized request that can fail on its own; on ActiveCampaign it is a

	 * contact read before it is believed, which costs one call on that path only and
	 * turns a flaking provider into unresolved rows rather than a clean run.
	 *
	 * What this closes, precisely: a failure that persists across two reads. It does
	 * not close a single transient one, on any provider. Mailchimp's and Constant
	 * Contact's get_contact_lists() are get_contact_data() plus a filter, so the
	 * corroborating call re-issues the request that just failed and a blip clearing
	 * in between reads as "no lists"; ActiveCampaign's list read is a separate
	 * endpoint the corroborating call never touches at all. Deciding this from the

	 * read fails — for any reason, a transient provider failure included, since it
	 * only tests is_wp_error() — it takes its create-contact branch, upserts the
	 * contact with the (here empty) add list, and returns true. So a removal that
	 * never touched the list can still come back true, and treating that as success
	 * would stamp a still-subscribed reader as clean: a real leak converted into a
	 * pass, in the one place this command writes.
	 *
	 * Reading the lists back closes that, but only as far as the re-read itself can be
	 * trusted — and it goes through the same provider methods, which swallow a failed
	 * request into an empty array. So one transient failure produces both halves at
	 * once: the write takes the create-contact branch and removes nothing, and the
	 * confirming read comes back empty and reads as "the list is gone". An empty
	 * re-read is therefore only accepted as evidence when the contact still resolves
	 * on a further read; without that it is indistinguishable from a swallowed
	 * failure. A re-read that still names other lists is evidence on its own — an
	 * empty array is the only ambiguous shape.
	 *
	 * Anything short of the list being visibly gone is 'unresolved' rather than
	 * 'removed' — a failed removal, an untrustworthy re-read and a re-read still
	 * showing the list all mean the same thing to an operator, which is that this
