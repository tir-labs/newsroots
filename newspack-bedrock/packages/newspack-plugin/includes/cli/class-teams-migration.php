/**
 * WP-CLI commands to migrate WooCommerce Memberships (Teams and manual plans) to
 * Newspack Access Control group subscriptions, plus a backfill for group managers.
 *
 * Ported from the standalone `migrate-memberships` drop-in so the tooling ships
 * with the plugin and writes through the real Group_Subscription data layer. Note
 * that CLI\Initializer::init() includes this file on every request; only the
 * WP_CLI::add_command() registration is gated behind WP_CLI, so nothing here should
 * assume a CLI-only execution context.
 *
 * Member and manager writes go through update_members()/add_manager(), which fire
 * only the group cache-reset hook — no data events, ESP sync, or emails. WooCommerce
 * transactional emails are suppressed during runs that create subscriptions. Note
 * that activating created subscriptions still fires the standard
 * `woocommerce_subscription_status_*` actions, which downstream ESP/network sync may
 * listen to; on a large migration prefer a low-traffic window.

	/**
	 * Migrate all active team memberships to Newspack group subscriptions.
	 *
	 * For teams already linked to an active subscription: enables the group
	 * subscription settings, adds all team members as group members, and promotes
	 * any team member whose Teams role is `manager` to a group manager.
	 *
	 * For teams with no linked subscription: reuses the group subscription this team
	 * was previously migrated to (stamped with MIGRATED_TEAM_ID_META_KEY), falling
	 * back to an unmarked group subscription owned by the team owner for groups from
	 * migrator runs predating per-team marking. If none is found, creates a new $0
	 * subscription on the given product.
	 *
	 * The command is idempotent — re-running it updates existing group
	 * subscriptions in place rather than creating duplicates. Reuse keys on the
	 * source team, so an owner who owns several teams migrates to one group
	 * subscription per team rather than a single merged group. When --product-id is
	 * supplied, every re-used $0 subscription has its line items replaced with the
	 * migration product.
	 *
	 * A team whose linked subscription is one the publisher actually bills is
	 * migrated in place: it gains the group settings and keeps its own product,
	 * price, taxes and billing schedule. Forcing a subscription to $0 is only
	 * correct where the access being carried over was free in Memberships. Because
	 * such a subscription keeps its own schedule, the team's Teams end date is not
	 * carried onto it, so the group can outlive the membership it came from.
	 *
	 * A subscription already cancelled but paid through the end of its term
	 * (pending-cancel) is migrated in place for the same reason and keeps its
	 * scheduled end date, whatever its total. Its members hold access for the rest
	 * of the paid term and lose it when the subscription self-cancels, which is
	 * what the reader asked for; re-aligning it onto the migration product would
	 * overwrite that end date and extend their access indefinitely.
	 *
	 * Two cases are skipped rather than migrated, and reported as errors in the
	 * summary: a paid team whose own product no published gate accepts, since
	 * granting access would mean rewriting what the publisher charges; and a team
	 * whose paid subscription is on hold for payment recovery and which has no
	 * migrated group to update, since creating one would hand the owner permanent
	 * free access and remove their reason to fix their payment method.
	 *
	 * Pending team invitations are not re-sent. Their existing `join-team` links keep
	 * working: once WooCommerce Teams is deactivated the plugin answers that route and
	 * maps each link onto this migration's group subscription. The run lists the
	 * pending invitees so the scale is on the record.
	 *
	 * Dry-run by default; pass --live to write.
	 *
	 * ## OPTIONS
	 *
	 * [--product-id=<id>]
	 * : Product to assign to newly-created subscriptions. Accepts a product ID or a variation ID — pass the variation when a publisher sells seat tiers as variations of one variable subscription product. Must be published and accepted by a published gate's "Active subscription" rule. Also re-aligns any re-used $0 subscription onto this product; a re-used subscription the team pays for keeps its own product, price, taxes and billing schedule. Required unless --skip-unlinked is passed.
	 *
	 * [--live]
	 * : Apply the changes. Without this flag the command runs as a dry-run and writes nothing.
	 *
	 * [--skip-unlinked]
	 * : Skip teams that have no linked subscription. Skipped teams are listed in a separate table at the end.
	 *
	 * [--only-unlinked]
	 * : Only process teams that have no linked subscription. Use to safely re-run the command for previously skipped teams.
	 *
	 * ## EXAMPLES
	 *
	 *     wp newspack migrate-teams --product-id=519858
	 *     wp newspack migrate-teams --product-id=519858 --live

	/**
	 * Create free subscriptions for users with active memberships that no live
	 * subscription backs.
	 *
	 * By default, iterates through membership plans with manual-only access and
	 * creates free WooCommerce Subscriptions for active members, skipping only
	 * staff who bypass the content gate outright -- users with a privileged
	 * capability like `edit_others_posts` (i.e. administrators/editors).
	 * `Group_Subscription::is_eligible_member()` does not gate this path;
	 * eligibility only applies to group mode, below.
	 *
	 * Plans with purchase/signup access can only be targeted with a member
	 * selection flag — --only-without-live-subscription and/or
	 * --user-ids/--user-ids-file — because blanket-processing them would create
	 * $0 subscriptions for every active member, including real paying
	 * subscribers. The comp/legacy residual class both flags target is
	 * "membership active, but no subscription in a live status": that includes
	 * members with no subscription at all AND members whose subscriptions exist
	 * only in dead states (cancelled/expired — and `pending`, since a checkout
	 * that never completed grants no access) — the lapsed cohort is often the
	 * larger one.
	 *
	 * Teams sites: run migrate-teams BEFORE a broad sweep. A live group
	 * subscription a member belongs to counts as live (no redundant personal $0
	 * subscription), but that only holds once migrate-teams has created the
	 * group subscriptions; before that, team members look like residuals.
	 * Constrain with --plan-ids if unsure.
	 *
	 * Group mode (--as-group) is NOT idempotent: it creates a new group
	 * subscription on every run. Individual mode is re-run safe — members who
	 * already hold an active migration-created subscription for the product are
	 * skipped. Dry-run by default; pass --live to write.
	 *
	 * Under --as-group, members are added through the group data layer, which adds
	 * any user eligible per `Group_Subscription::is_eligible_member()` -- readers
	 * plus Author/Contributor by default, filterable via
	 * `newspack_group_subscription_member_eligible` -- and skips (and tallies,
	 * reported inline) the rest, whereas individual mode gives every processed
	 * member their own subscription.
	 *
	 * ## OPTIONS
	 *
	 * --product-id=<id>
	 * : The product ID to use when creating the new subscriptions.
	 *
	 * [--plan-ids=<ids>]
	 * : Comma-delimited list of membership plan IDs to process. If omitted, all published plans with _access_method = manual-only are used — or ALL published plans when --only-without-live-subscription or --user-ids/--user-ids-file is passed. Parsing is strict: a malformed token aborts the run.
	 *
	 * [--only-without-live-subscription]
	 * : Only process members who do NOT own (or belong to a group on) a subscription in a live status (active, on-hold, pending-cancel) FOR A PRODUCT THE GATES ACCEPT. Members whose subscriptions are all in dead states (cancelled, expired, pending, ...), or are only for products no gate accepts, are included, same as members with no subscription at all. Skipped members are counted per user so the output reconciles against a parity diff.
	 *
	 * [--access-product-ids=<ids>]
	 * : Comma-delimited product IDs that grant access under the new gates — the audit's ACCESS_PRODUCT_IDS. Scopes which subscriptions count as covering a member, and is the pre-flight's reference set: EVERY mode (including the legacy manual-only default) refuses a --product-id outside it, so pass this to unblock a run whose gates do not yet list the migration product. Defaults to the products named by the `subscription` access rules of published gates with custom access switched on. With --only-without-live-subscription, an empty resolved list aborts a --live run (any live subscription would count as covering).
	 *
	 * [--user-ids=<ids>]
	 * : Comma-delimited list of user IDs to process (explicit input mode). Only active members of the processed plans whose user ID is on this list are handled; list entries never matched are reported at the end. Combines with --user-ids-file.
	 *
	 * [--user-ids-file=<path>]
	 * : Path to a file of user IDs to process (comma-, space-, or newline-delimited). Combines with --user-ids.
	 *
	 * [--skip-domains=<domains>]
	 * : Comma-delimited list of email domains to skip (e.g. example.com,example.org). Any user whose email address belongs to one of these domains will be skipped.
	 *
	 * [--as-group]
	 * : Instead of creating one subscription per member, create a single $0 group subscription per plan and add all qualifying members as group members. Requires --group-owner-id, and explicit --plan-ids when combined with a member selection flag.
	 *
	 * [--group-owner-id=<id>]
	 * : User ID to set as the owner of each group subscription created when --as-group is used. Required when --as-group is present.
	 *
	 * [--live]
	 * : Apply the changes. Without this flag the command runs as a dry-run and writes nothing.
	 *

	/**
	 * Backfill group managers from WooCommerce Teams manager roles.
	 *
	 * The `migrate-teams` command flattened every Teams member to a plain group
	 * member on already-migrated sites, dropping the manager designation. This
	 * re-designates managers: for every published team, it resolves the group
	 * subscription (the team's linked active subscription, else the group this team
	 * was migrated to by team marker, else an unmarked group owned by the team owner)
	 * and promotes each member whose Teams role is `manager` — and who is already a
	 * group member — to a group manager.
	 *
	 * Dry-run by default; pass --live to write. Idempotent — members already
	 * managing are left untouched.
	 *
	 * ## OPTIONS
	 *
	 * [--live]
	 * : Apply the changes. Without this flag the command runs as a dry-run and writes nothing.
	 *
	 * ## EXAMPLES
	 *
	 *     wp newspack backfill-team-managers
	 *     wp newspack backfill-team-managers --live
	 *
	 * @param array $args       Positional args (unused).

	/**
	 * Resolve the group subscription to reuse for a team whose linked subscription was
	 * not reusable.
	 *
	 * Prefers the group subscription this team was previously migrated to (stamped with
	 * MIGRATED_TEAM_ID_META_KEY), so reuse keys on the team and a multi-team owner keeps
	 * one group subscription per team. A marker match wins whatever its status: a team
	 * whose group has since expired or been put on hold must reuse that group rather
	 * than get a second, duplicate one on the next run (when the reused group's status
	 * withholds access the caller is told via `reused_without_access` so it can warn).
	 * Falls back to an active group subscription owned by the team owner that carries no
	 * marker, and flags that fallback so the caller can warn.
	 *
	 * The fallback additionally requires the subscription's *own*
	 * `_newspack_group_subscription_enabled` meta, not just
	 * Group_Subscription::is_group_subscription(): that reads through to product-level
	 * settings, and migrate-team-products stamps group meta on every team product, so
	 * after the companion product migration a sibling team's live linked subscription
	 * would otherwise look adoptable and get merged into this team's group. Only a group
	 * an earlier migrator run (or a publisher) explicitly enabled carries the meta on
	 * the subscription itself.
	 *
	 * A marked group the publisher has since turned group subscriptions off on is neither
	 * reused nor ignored: when the team has no usable group left, those groups are reported
	 * via `disabled_marked_group_ids` and the caller refuses the team. Reusing one would
	 * re-enable a flag the publisher deliberately set (migrate-teams stamps
	 * `_newspack_group_subscription_enabled` unconditionally), while ignoring it would create
	 * a second group stamped with the same team ID — so the call belongs to the operator,
	 * who either re-enables the group or clears its marker. A team that also has a usable
	 * marked group (the split state an earlier duplicating run could leave behind) is
	 * migrated into that one and reports nothing, since refusing a team whose group is
	 * there to be updated would block a migration that has somewhere valid to go.
	 *
	 * Both lookups run over a single pass of the owner's subscriptions. Discovery is
	 * scoped to the team's current owner (migrated groups are owned by their team owner),
	 * which assumes the owner has not changed since the team was migrated; if it has, the
	 * prior group is owned by the old owner and is not found here, so a re-run creates a
	 * fresh group for the team rather than reusing the original.
	 *
	 * Dry-run caveat: migrate-teams stamps the marker only on a live run, so a dry-run
	 * preview of an owner whose only group carries no marker shows each of their teams
	 * adopting that one group (the live run avoids the merge by marking it on the first
	 * team). The preview over-reports the merge rather than hiding one, so the live
	 * outcome is always safe.
