	 *
	 * Keyed per pass rather than held as a single flag because 'the_content' nests:

	 * removed before self::RESTRICTION_PRIORITY, then re-added by a callback above
	 * it, over a leftover entry at this same depth, on a restricted post. Short of
	 * all four the mismatch falls through to the stored teaser and gate, so the

	 *
	 * Two conditions, either of which stands gating down:
	 *
	 * - The feature constant. Access Control is only on where someone put it.
	 * - Audience Management (NPPD-1846). Everything a gate hands the reader off
