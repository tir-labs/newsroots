/**
 * Resolves WooCommerce Teams `join-team` links against group subscriptions.
 *
 * WooCommerce Teams invites readers with `/my-account/join-team/i_<token>`, and
 * offers a team's owner an open `/my-account/join-team/<registration-key>` link
 * anyone may follow. Both are My Account endpoints the Teams plugin registers, so
 * deactivating it at the Access Control flip unregisters the route and every link
 * already sitting in a reader's inbox starts returning a 404 — indefinitely, since
 * neither link carries an expiry.
 *
 * This registers the same route once Teams is gone and maps each token onto the
 * Access Control equivalent of what it used to open: an invitation onto an invite
 * for that one address, a registration key onto the group's invite link. Resolution
 * happens at click time against the `wc_team_invitation` and `wc_memberships_team`
 * rows the flip leaves behind, keyed on the source team migrate-teams stamped on the
 * group subscription it created. Nothing is built at migration time, so there is no
 * mapping table to keep in step with either side.
 *
 * Every path here is reached by a bearer token no Access Control screen displays, so
 * a link stops working when the thing it points at is withdrawn. Joining spends the
 * source invitation, cancelling the minted invite spends it too, an address that is
 * already a member spends it, and a group whose owner disabled their invite link does
 * not get a replacement minted by the next click on an old registration URL.
 *
 * Two configurations reach only the fallback notice. A site that uninstalled
 * WooCommerce Teams *with data deletion* rather than deactivating it has no rows left
 * to resolve against. And a half-done flip — Teams deactivated, WooCommerce
 * Memberships left active — cannot resolve a group subscription at all, because
 * Group_Subscription::is_group_subscription() deliberately answers false on My
 * Account pages while Memberships owns the front end, and this route is a My Account
 * page. The migration deactivates both together, so the second is transient.
 *
 * One deliberate parity gap: Teams stored an invited member's role on the invitation
 * (`post_mime_type`), and an outstanding *manager* invitation resolved here produces
 * a plain member. migrate-teams promotes managers from team member roles rather than
 * from pending invitations, so honouring the role here would be the only place in the
 * migration that reads it.
