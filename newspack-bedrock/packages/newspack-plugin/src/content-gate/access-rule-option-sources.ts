/**
 * Option sources for access rules whose choices are fetched at edit time rather than

 * editor's visibility panel.
 *
 * The fetched list replaces the localised one, so it has to be complete: a value no
 * option describes renders as "not listed" and loses its suggestion with it, so a
 * truncated list turns real, still-granting IDs into entries a publisher can only
 * remove. `per_page` is capped at 100 by the REST API while `Institution::get_options()`
 * has no such cap, so these requests ask for `per_page=-1` — api-fetch's fetch-all
 * middleware then walks the collection's pages and returns the whole thing.
 *
 * Walking the collection costs one round trip per hundred items, so each rule's list is
 * fetched once and every later reader resolves from that same promise. Writes to the
 * fetched collection drop the entry through `invalidateAccessRuleOptions()`.
