 * Safe to short-circuit the whole section: the Wizard resets header data on every
 * route change, so no stale header action survives into the blocked state.
 *
 * Call at module scope, never inside a component body. Each call mints a new

 * that changes identity between renders remounts the section subtree and discards
 * in-progress editor state.
