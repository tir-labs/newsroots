/**
 * Carry a reader to the notice reporting a failed submit.
 *
 * For a form whose button sits far below its notice. Focus doubles as the
 * announcement here, which is why the notice goes silent once a submit has happened;
 * where focus would interrupt someone who carried on while the request was in flight
 * it is declined and the message is spoken instead, so nobody is left with neither.
 *
 * @param errorMessage The current failure message, or null when there is none.
 * @param label        Accessible name for the notice container.
 * @return Props for the notice wrapper, a submit handler, and the notice's `spokenMessage`.
 *         Pass the click event to the submit handler: the element it came from is what
 *         tells the effect whether the reader has since moved on, and without it focus
 *         is taken unconditionally.
